# Shell Scripting Overview

This project explores fundamental concepts of shell scripting in Linux, including working with environment variables, local variables, and shell variables, and understanding how they differ in scope and persistence.

It covers practical tasks such as creating aliases, modifying the `PATH`, listing variables and functions, and cleaning up the environment. Arithmetic operations are performed using variables from the environment, including addition, division, exponentiation, and base conversion.

The project also demonstrates control structures to generate combinations of letters and the use of formatting tools like `printf` to handle floating-point numbers.

Overall, these exercises provide hands-on experience with variable management, process environments, arithmetic expansion, and output formattingâ€”key building blocks for effective shell scripting.
